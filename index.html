<h3> Bio: </h3>
  <p> I'm a teen who loves to read and write. My love of writing began when I first read the Hunger Games series my freshman year of highschool. The way she wrote made me believe I could change the world with writing. Even though I was inspired, I never got serious about writing until my second year in high school. I finished my first novel at in a year at 16, just as I was going into my junior year of highschool. I'm planning to write many more. Going into my senior year of high school, I can’t wait for graduation, and what my future will hold.</p>
<p>The stories I love to write are romance and YA fiction. I'm also into drawing, painting, singing, and designing book covers. Here you can find some of the projects I've done. Please contact me if you're interested in my work.</p>
